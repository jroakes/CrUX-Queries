*  What is the real use case for CrUX? It’s showing how well or how bad you’re doing among competitors, more than likely to get investment in WPO. A histogram makes  the most sense due to the time series, but it may be hard for an executive to digest. You need static comparison metrics. Maybe a series of boxes representing percent of users at 1, 2, 3 seconds.

*  I wish the data was categorized by industry. Because benchmarking against a category would be very useful, especially since you can’t have conversion data for competitors

* Since Google has metrics for dropout of conversions and engagement per second increase, what do you think about calculating that WRT competitors and their speed? (edited)

* Last time i ran a CrUX query, I got sad a domain wasn’t in there. I know they expanded the DB, but I’m sure small biz folks are going to find their sites aren’t visible in the report. There should be messaging around that.

*  Not just histograms but averages. Easy way to pull individual page level data. Besides that the normal filters they have for different metrics, locations, speeds, devices. Comparison data for month over month.

*  We'd need the individual URLs anyway to make a more complete report now that data studio lets you blend different sources. That one is going to be important.

*  Pull pagespeed insights in also

*  Haven't looked at the metrics, but are they available by URL?  Also, if we're talking wishlist items, I'd a graph with anomalous behavior (compared to site average)

*  I think wrapping a metric in a fan chart of how unlikely it is based on past performance would be interesting
